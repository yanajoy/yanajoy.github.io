The ten-storey block is located in Timiryazeva Park, Novosibirsk – a former industrial park with greenhouses that is being converted into a residential and commercial neighbourhood centred around a public park and sculpture garden.
All ten storeys contain apartments, varying in size from 70 to 105 square metres. They can be accessed by lift as well as by staircase, and these lifts open directly into each home.
Some apartments feature windows facing in two different directions, ensuring that each home is filled with plenty of natural light and ventilation.
Good proportions, flowing spaces and fabulous views – these primary architectural aspects define the quality of the apartments.
The brick pattern is seen in different ways, rather like a musical motif, knitting the different typologies together despite their wide variety.
We used tall buildings and brick to establish a robust, solid presence at the entrance, and incorporated a landscaping scheme that features outdoor play and games facilities, and extensive planting, which encourages people to use this space.
The urban project proposes a rigorous organisation of blocks arranged together in a series of steady colours and natural materials, all falling within a sort of historic continuity that preserves the original residential character.
All the rooms are fitted with large windows highlighting the link between indoors and outdoors. These windows include a broad wood and metal frame. All the windows are fitted with wooden sliding and folding shutters which serve to block out the sun or close off the window. These shutters are made of natural larch from European sources. The external frame is aluminium, painted the same colour as the facade, which is a greyish-brown terracotta tone. The windows are extra-large in the living rooms highlighting the comfort and pleasure of being at home.
