It is a small apartment building for rent, standing on the corner of Respublicanskaya street. Building has it's own parking, two playgrounds and orchard.  
The neighbourhood is dominated by old housing constructed to meet the demand of the local community and the unusual facade treatment is a deliberate attempt to distinguish the building from its surroundings.
Clay bricks infused with metal shavings make up the orthogonal exterior of an apartment block.
All dimensions of the building are derived from the proportions of the bricks used for the facade, in order to avoid cutting them.
The purpose of the building, lot performance, urban planning and construction codes define the buildingÂ´s volumetry, with the use of the whole property, including the basement for parking and engine room.
The building envelope was made of brick, which was carefully applied according to its use in each parament.
The entire project was thought based on brick measures in order to avoid their being cut. We paid special attention to joint measures between bricks and their depth. Horizontal joints are 1cm thick, while those of 2cm were taken as 2,5 cm in order to hide the support mortar.
