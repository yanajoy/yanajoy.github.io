The beautiful cottage is located in privat community near the river Karakan, Novosibirskaya oblast. There are designed some houses in this style. 2 of them are presented in this portfolio.
This place is located far away from big city, in the forest and designed for the family’s holiday on the nature.

The home is entered through a nearly 4,000 m courtyard. The stone and wooden columns flank the entry and are repeated throughout the home.

This home blends in with the natural surroundings of it’s hillside perch, and is so intoxicatingly beautiful, one hardly notices its numerous energy saving and green features.
Durable, natural and handsome materials such as stained cedar trim, natural stone veneer, and integral color plaster are combined with strong horizontal roof lines that emphasize the expansive nature of the site.

Large expanses of glass punctuated with a natural rhythm of exposed beams and stone columns that frame the spectacular views of the Karakan forest.
