320 Norwood Residence is located in USA near Boston. Client wanted stick to modern style in landscape design. I used cedar wooden elements in construction of patio and lounge zone, and concrete slabs and paving. Added some interesting decorative walls with stone cladding and planting beds with salvia and pennisetum. Since there are a lot of trees on the left of the house, I added some colorful trees (because existing trees all are green) - "dogwood" (white) "box elder" (green red) "maple ginnala" (yellow red) and some trees with good form and flowers. Flowering bushes are located only on the right of back-yard.  Other bushes are connected with trees. Slope is decorated with natural stones, small bushes (Hakonechloa) and with Juniper bushes. Green open space with lawn completes of area, with playground for children.
