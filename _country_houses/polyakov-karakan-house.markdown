The beautiful cottage is located in privat community near the river Karakan, Novosibirskaya oblast. There are designed some houses in this style. 2 of them are presented in this portfolio.
This place is located far away from big city, in the forest and designed for the family’s holiday on the nature.

The home is entered through a nearly 4,000 m courtyard. The stone and wooden columns flank the entry and are repeated throughout the home.

Another view of the front entry and courtyard. Use of different materials helps to highlight the homes contemporary take on a lodge style home.

Looking back over the pool and bath house to the home's rear elevation.

Exterior materials and interior spaces are a contemporary interpretation of the traditional cottage vocabulary. The design and workmanship are expressed in the oversized stone fireplace and chimney, radiant stone floors, metal roofs, rough-sawn timbers, hand-planed boarding, and detailed built-in millwork. The cottage also features radiant floors, low-e glazing, networked wiring, low-voltage lighting, a home theatre, and a state-of-the-art kitchen.

While modern in attitude, the cottage’s vernacular forms and local wood products bond it to the this region, affording it with a strong sense of place. A durable roof, high-performance insulation, and energy-efficient heating system provide long term-value and sustainability.
