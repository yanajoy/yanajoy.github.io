Client wanted to see traditional style of landscape design - with a curve-lined pathway, with natural boulders and colorful plants.
But the place was Sacramento, California which is well known for its dry climate and we had to choose only drought-tolerant plants which don't need much water.
Also we made a decision to remove the lawn with mulch and pea gravel- that's how we separated area into different zones. Usung a lot of interesting plants of different colours, shape and appearance we have been able to fill this area completely as well as traditional style. Small trees have bright shades of leaves - Japahese maple(red leafed) Sawleaf Zelkova (green leafed) and Crape Myrtle have wonderful white flowers.
Firts line of the front yard - perennials, the composition from white and yellow Coreopsis looks unusual and delights the eye.
Heather was very happy - I created for her a new place for resting and her numerous friends, I made a beautiful garden which does not require any special care, I also fully refreshed her small frontyard.
"I love it, thank you!I'm so excited. This looks great! This will probably take me around a year to do, but I'll be happy to send you photos once finished!" (c) Heather
