That's my second landscape project for California with an arid climate.
Rod asked me to create for him landscape, using drought-tolerant plants - for two different places.
It was very exciting, but finally, I chose the same plants for every houses. The emphasis was on the big Agave with an interesting shape and on the natural boulders, others perennials and ornamental grass should decorate these emphases. All perennials don't need any special care, but they create some bright spots on the slopes.
