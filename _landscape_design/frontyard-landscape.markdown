When the family spent time outdoors, they were hoping to find flamboyant color, delicious fragrance, freshly grilled food, fun play-spaces, and comfy entertaining areas waiting.
Privacy was an imperative.
But a heap of challenges stood in the way between what they were given upon arrival and the family's ultimate dreamscape.
The front yard of the home was completely stripped away and and rebuilt from the curbside up to the home. Extensive retaining decorative walls married with stone stair and landing elements complement the overall look of the home.
Strong modern lines lead visitors toward the front door in a visual invitation to enter, and lush, sprawling foliage spills into the clean contours of concrete, creating a striking juxtaposition between natural and built elements.
A detail of the front concrete planter shows the contrast in color and texture.
I like the way the various walls were created and how they formed different planting beds.
