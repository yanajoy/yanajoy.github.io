We consider playgrounds an integral part of public space. We strive for playgrounds to be inviting places to be discovered; providing room for different groups and ages, and several forms of use. We want playgrounds to be challenging and safe at the same time. Faced with too many restricted area’s for kids only, today’s facilities strictly focus on certain age groups and are filled in with prefabricated furniture which is directive as well as limited in terms of use.
In our plans we incorporate intended and possible users and ‘playable’ functions. In examining these possibilities we do look for the overlap in functions, through ages and user-groups. The outcome of this provides a firm basis. By playing out preconceptions about play and the strict ‘locating’ of different age groups we like to keep some space free as well, to be filled in by the users.
