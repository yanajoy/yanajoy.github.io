Newly installed planting enhance the architectural features.
The ground-level patio connects to the home by two raised patio decks. The outdoor spaces are defined by low concrete walls capped with stone.
Four new trees punctuate the symmetrical balance of the new landscape.
Layered walls perform double duty as both sculpture and a way to define gathering spaces. Contrasting leaf textures and hues harmonize with the hardscape, and plant masses add their colorful statement to the canvas.
Repetition of materials like stone, concrete combine beautifully to form a bold and contemporary garden.
This total perimeter infinity edge pool acts as a mirror. It reflects the surroundings creating a very clean, simple design as not to compete with the natural landscape.
Taking advantage of a grade drop at the rear of the property, we created a dramatic water feature using the spillway of the pool. An expansive deck off the house fits both a comfortable lounge and outdoor dining room with bar seating.
A fire pit beckons from the deck to enjoy the pool in the nighttime light. The garden also includes a vegetable garden and espaliered fruit trees.
