This house is what we call a traditional.
And client wanted a greenhouse and some raised garden beds close to the greenhouse. We used trees staggered to block the view behind her - christmas trees, with a few regular type trees sprinkled in.
In the pavilion they wanted an outdoor kitchen and rest zone near fireplace.
