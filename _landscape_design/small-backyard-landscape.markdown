This my client bought a new house with a long driveway. And he wanted to enjoy surrounding during the way. My basic idea was - avenue of white flowering trees and hakone grass on the ground. At the beginning of the road and at the end of the road - there are some shrubs of white hydrangea and pink azalea, borders of the road are decorated by decorative stone-cladding walls.
Also night illumination along the whole road is provided.
