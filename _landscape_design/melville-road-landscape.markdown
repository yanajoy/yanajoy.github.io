This project is a good example of fast 3d visualization and planning. Masterplan and landscape design for small community - my favorite part of this job. Very popular plants such as crape myrtle, prunus, cordiline, banksia, lomandra and etc were chosen for Australian climate. Every courtyard turned out to be very cosy and colourful.
